  "readme": "#  [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]\n\n> [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog) [jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) preset\n\n**Issues with the convention itself should be reported on the JSHint issue tracker.**\n\n## JSHint Convention\n\n### Overview\n\nCommit messages are written in a simple format which clearly describes the purpose of a change.\n\nThe format in general should look like this:\n\n```\n[[TYPE]] <Short description>\n<Blank line>\n\n<Body / Detailed description>\n\n<Footer>\n```\n\nLine lengths in commit messages are not strict, but good commit messages should have headers of no\nmore than 60 characters, and bodies/footers wrapped at 100 columns. This renders nicely on Github's\nUI.\n\n### Header\n\nThe first line is the commit message header, which will indicate the type of change, and a general\ndescription of the change. This should fit within 60 characters, ideally. For instance:\n\n```\n[[FIX]] Ignore \"nocomma\" when parsing object literals\n```\n\nThe title `[[FIX]]` indicates that the change is a bugfix, while the remainder clarifies what the\nchange actually contains.\n\nSeveral commit types are used by jshint:\n\n1. `[[FIX]]` --- Commit fixes a bug or regression\n2. `[[FEAT]]` --- Commit introduces new functionality\n3. `[[DOCS]]` --- Commit modifies documentation. Docs commits should only touch comments in source code, or scripts and assets which are used to generate the documentation.\n4. `[[TEST]]` --- Commit modifies tests or test infrastructure only\n5. `[[CHORE]]` --- Commit affects dev-ops, CI, or package dependencies\n\n### Body\n\n`<Body>` is a detailed commit message explaining exactly what has changed, and a summary of the\nreason why. Lines in the body should be wrapped to 100 characters for best rendering.\n\nFor a historical example, see this [example](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/commit/5751c5ed249b7a035758a3ae876cfa1a360fd144)\n\n### Footer\n\n`<Footer>` contains a description of any breaking changes, no matter how subtle, as well as a list\nof issues affected or fixed by this commit. Lines in the footer should be wrapped to 100 characters\nfor best rendering.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```\n[[FEAT]] Enable `norecurs` option by default\n\nCommit 124124a7f introduced an option which forbids recursion. We liked it so much, we've enabled\nit by default.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE:\n\nThis change will break the CI builds of many applications and frameworks.\n\nIn order to work around this issue, you will need to re-engineer your applications and frameworks\nto avoid making recursive calls. Use Arrays as stacks rather than relying on the VM call stack.\n\nFixes #1000009\nCloses #888888\nCloses #77777\n```\n\nBased on https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-guidelines\n\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/conventional-changelog-jshint.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/conventional-changelog-jshint\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/stevemao/conventional-changelog-jshint.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/stevemao/conventional-changelog-jshint\n[daviddm-image]: https://david-dm.org/stevemao/conventional-changelog-jshint.svg?theme=shields.io\n[daviddm-url]: https://david-dm.org/stevemao/conventional-changelog-jshint\n[coveralls-image]: https://coveralls.io/repos/stevemao/conventional-changelog-jshint/badge.svg\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/stevemao/conventional-changelog-jshint\n",
